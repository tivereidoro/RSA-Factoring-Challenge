# RSA FACTORING CHALLENGE

## Background Context

An unsecured network was sniffed out and numbers that are used to encrypt very important documents were found. It seems that those numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers. The mission is to factorize these numbers as fast as possible before the target fixes this bug on their server - so that we can decode the encrypted documents.

## Tasks
###Factorize all!

Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.

Usage: factors where is a file containing natural numbers to factor. One number per line You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers greater than 1 You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space before and after the valid number The file will always end with a new line Output format: n=p*q one factorization per line p and q don’t have to be prime numbers See example You can work on the numbers of the file in the order of your choice Your program should run without any dependency: You will not be able to install anything on the machine we will run your program on Time limit.

###RSA Factoring Challenge

RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that

n = p × q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

This task is the same as task 0, except:

p and q are always prime numbers There is only one number in the files How far can you go in less than 5 seconds?
